Lets assume that the project is written in Go. To take care of linting we can use a popular Go package called golint. For testing we can use a library called testing that comes with the Go standard library so there is no additional setup needed to use it. For building the source code we can use another standard library package called build. At the same time we can support different architectures and operating systems since the compiler can be told to generate executables for different combinations.
As an alternative to Jenkins or GitHub Actions, we have a huge selection to choose from. If we were to use GitLab for storing the repository, we could use GitLab's own CI/CD tool. The positive here would be that all the DevOps related stuff would be in one place. If we want to go for an open source solution without self-hosting we could opt for Travis CI that supports multiple languages, including Go. 
Considering that the application is developed by a small group of developers, self-hosting, atleast initally, won't be needed. If the application or team grows in the future, there might be a need to rethink this. Other things that would warranty self-hosting is that with self-hosting we could control the CI ourselves without relying on other services. Also the potential security benefits that could come with self-hosting the CI should be taken into consideration.
